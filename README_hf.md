# Brainmarks-sMRI

Eleven public structural brain MRI datasets for evaluating sMRI foundation models, with classification, regression and segmentation targets. The images are the original releases, unmodified. Each dataset adds harmonized metadata tables and fixed train/val/test splits.

Each dataset folder's `README.md` has its source, version, license, citation, and split details.

## Layout

```
<dataset>/
  README.md          # source, version, license, citation, splits
  manifest.sha256    # checksums of source/; verify with `sha256sum -c manifest.sha256`
  source/            # the original release, verbatim
  tables/
    images.tsv       # one row per image: participant_id, session_id, modality, desc, path
    samples.tsv      # one row per scan session: participant_id, session_id, age, sex, site (where the source has them), targets...
    samples.json     # column descriptions, levels and units
    splits.tsv       # one row per participant: participant_id, split, official_split, rank, complete
```

- Paths in `images.tsv` are relative to `<dataset>/`.
- Splits are by participant. Official splits are kept where they exist; otherwise the split is 60/20/20, stratified, with a fixed seed.
- `complete` marks participants with all core images and the primary targets.
- `rank` orders participants within each split so that the lowest-ranked N form a balanced subset; subsets are nested as N grows.

## Usage

```sh
hf download medarc/brainmarks-smri --repo-type dataset --include "pixar/*" --local-dir brainmarks-smri
```

```python
import pandas as pd

root = "brainmarks-smri/pixar"
images = pd.read_csv(f"{root}/tables/images.tsv", sep="\t")
samples = pd.read_csv(f"{root}/tables/samples.tsv", sep="\t")
splits = pd.read_csv(f"{root}/tables/splits.tsv", sep="\t")

# A balanced 50-participant training subset.
train = splits[(splits.split == "train") & splits.complete]
train_50 = train.nsmallest(50, "rank").participant_id
```
